<details>
<summary>The SCORE Project has a simple goal: help to standardize the creation and use of physiological composite risk endpoints.</summary>
<p>As more research studies in the health and social sciences collect multiple biomarkers, there is an increasing desire to
    "reduce dimensionality" or otherwise summarise related biomarkers into composites, often for use as endpoints, but also 
    as predictors.
</p>
<p>The field of psychometrics has long delt with how to use multiple (potentially noisy) indicators of an underlying construct,
    like health, or cardio-metabolic risk, or ..., but these techniques have not been applied to biological data by enlarge.
    Studies that do collect biomarkers and create composites often have slightly different composites, because 
    each study assesses a different set of biomarkers.  In psychometrics, standard scales are developed and people tend to 
    use these scales.  No such standardized equivalents exist for biomarkers.
</p>
<p>
    The SCORE Project is all about changing this,
    understanding how biomarkers relate, creating reliable and validated composites that can be used, etc.
</p>

<h3><a id="composites" class="anchor" href="#composites" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Composites</h3>

<p>
    Presently, the SCORE Project is focused on developing and validating approaches 
    related to two composites, allostatic load and metabolic syndrome.
</p>

<h4>Allostatic Load (AL)</h4>

        <p>
            Allostatic load theory posits that repeated activation of the stress response
            results in wear-and-tear on the body manifested through physiological dysregulation 
            across the entire organism.
        </p>
        <p>
            A typical physiological stress response is shown below --- in response to stress,
            there is a strong reaction, and then there is a recovery after the stressor 
            ends.
        </p>
        <img src="figs/stress.gif" alt="typical stress response" width="50%"></img>
        <p>
            With repeated stressors, there are many possible responses.  Examples are an
            adaptive response where the reactivity to the same stressor diminishes over time
        </p>
        <img src="figs/adapt.gif" alt="typical stress response" width="50%"></img>
        <p>
            A non-adaptive response, where the reactivity remains just as strong 
            regardless of how many times the stressor is experienced.
        </p>
        <img src="figs/noadapt.gif" alt="typical stress response" width="50%"></img>
        <p>
            A failure to recovery response, where there is reaction that does not, 
            or incompletely terminates.        
        </p>
        <img src="figs/norecover.gif" alt="typical stress response" width="50%"></img>
        <p>
            A failure to react in the first place, or a dampened initial reaction 
            (associated with fatigue or a chronically stressed system).
        </p>

<h4>Metabolic Syndrome Symptom Score (MSSS)</h4>

<h3><a id="methods" class="anchor" href="#methods" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Methods</h3>
<details>
    <summary>There are many methods used to create biomarker composites.  
        Examples include:
        <ul>
            <li>sum of biomarkers at or above a "risk" threshold</li>
            <li>sum of standardized biomarker scores (z-score and sum)</li>
            <li> latent factor(s) using factor analysis or structural equation models</li>
            <li>principal component analysis</li>
            <li>Mahalanobis distance (may be either from the mean or other normative values, the mean, or some other threshold)</li>
        </ul>
    </summary>
    <p>Below is an example of some alternative factor models for allostatic load.</p>

<p>
    There is an <code>R</code> package in development to assist with the scoring and 
    creation of composites from biomarkers, available from this same github repository.
    Currently, it only has facilities for MSSS, but that is expanding.
