Description: Provides a number of functions to
  simplify and automate the scoring, comparison, and evaluation of
  different ways of creating composites of data.  It is particularly
  aimed at facilitating the creation of physiological composites of
  metabolic syndrome symptom score (MetSSS) and allostatic load (AL).
  Provides a wrapper to calculate the MetSSS on new data using the
  Healthy Hearts formula.
